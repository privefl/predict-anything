# Introduction

## Summary statistics vs individual-level data

<br>

- Summary statistics are not the only way to derive PGS

- Individual-level data can be used directly (i.e. the genotype matrix and the phenotypes)

- This makes sense now with large datasets such as the UKBB

- Plus, we can derive PGS for multiple phenotypes

- Using our fast implem of penalized regressions [1], we can use **only the UK Biobank** genetic and phenotypic data to derive PGS for **240 traits**.

## Major strength of the UK Biobank and this study

<br>

- A major concern about PGS is their transferability to other ancestries    
(e.g. bad performances in Africans for PGS trained in Europeans)

- We are well positioned to reiterate this concern with strong evidence

    - UKBB data contains 450K Europeans, 9000 South Asians, 1500 Chinese and 4000 Africans
    
    - who had their genetic and phenotypic information derived **in the same way**
    
    - plus we (I?) expect that LASSO penalty strongly limits the overfitting in the training data, and potentially transfer better to other ancestries

# Methods

## Genetic data


- 1,117,182 HapMap3 variants 

- 434,868 European ancestry, 8636 South Asian, 1803 East Asian, 6983 African

```{r, out.width="62%"}

```

## Phenotypic data

<br>

- Mapped ICD10 and ICD9 codes to phecodes $\rightarrow$ 104 phecodes with sufficient prediction

- Used other UKBB fields to define 111 continuous and 25 binary phenotypes

    $\Rightarrow$ 111 continuous + 129 binary = **240 phenotypes**

Some examples:

- body measures: height, BMI, BMD, etc.

- blood biochemistry: cholesterol, vitamin D, etc.

- ECG measures

## Penalized regressions

Find $\mu$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ that minimize

$$\underbrace{ ||y - (\mu + G \beta + X \gamma)||_2^2 }_\text{Loss function} + \underbrace{ \lambda \left( \alpha \|\beta\|_1 + (1 - \alpha) \frac{\|\beta\|_2^2}{2} \right) }_\text{Penalisation} ~,$$

where $G$ is the genotype matrix, $X$ is the covariate matrix, $y$ is the (quantitative) phenotype and $\lambda$ is a hyper-parameter that needs to be chosen.

Using $\alpha = 1$ is the LASSO, and I'm using $\alpha = 10^{-4}$ to approximate a ridge regression.

<br>

Also just added two extensions for the LASSO:

- allows different scaling (normal, Pareto, none)

- adaptive LASSO $\rightarrow$ less penalty for largest effects
